# Skyworld API

A project aimed to make BTA! Modded skyblock simpler for both devs and players alike!

***P.S.:Made by an absolute noob, please don't hurt me!***

## Planned features:
- Skyblock world generator with expandability via custom islands provided by other mods.
- Being detectable if a current world is using SkyworldAPI, which will allow mod makers to add recipes/events/mechanics exclusive to skyblock without affecting main game!
- Nether support!
- (Possibly inifinite skyblock generator; looping island patterns)
- Multiplayer support! It's always better to skyblock with a friend!
